# UFO Sightings
## Overview of the project:
### The purpose of this analysis is to showing the information of UFO-sightings based on the criteria entered by users in the filter panel. Users can filter by date, city, state, country and shape of the UFO.

## Results:
### If users want to search by date (e.g. 1/5/2010)

### If users want to search by country (e.g. Canada)

## Summary:
### One of the drawback of this project is that the data is not up-to-date, all the resources came from the historical information.
### My recommendation is to connect the project to an API or database in order to collect the up-to-date information if there is any new findings.
### Another recommendation is to collect UFO-sightings information from other countries to enrich our project as we only have limited countries in our data file. After that we can also analyze if there is any difference between the sightings observed in different countries.
